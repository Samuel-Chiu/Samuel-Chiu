- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Samuel-Chiu

  Here is some information about this Data set and the context in which I manipulated it:

1. The Data set is from Kaggle and is the mfsnowcrab.csv file. 
2. I did this project as a final exam for my CS 171: Fundamentals of R class.
3. The way in which I manipulated the data in this context is explained through the dashboard that accompanies rmd file.
